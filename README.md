# Memory Flags

Memory Flags is a memory game. The rules are simple: click every flag but only click each once.

## Notes

- Countries and flags are fetched from the [RESTcountries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/).
- This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum and the project requirements can be found there: <https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-memory-card>
